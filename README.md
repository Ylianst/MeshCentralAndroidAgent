# MeshCentral Agent for Android

This is the MeshCentral Agent for Android. It's a completely different code base from the agent used on Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD. You can pair the agent to the server by scanning a QR code. Once paired, you can connect
to the server and see the device show up, see the battery state, device details and download pictures, audio and video files.
